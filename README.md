# üèíNHLPA.css

Basic styles for HTML Elements. Providing a reasonable set of (mostly) styles without classes. Including a few basic components, utility classes (we call them "atoms").

## Getting Started

The point of the library is to encourage and support writing basic HTML, so the best way to learn is to starting writing an HTML document. You can also view the [demo](demo.html) for a full-ish reference, or the [css](nhlpa.css) file itself which is intended to be self-documenting.

## Design Goals

We love HTML, simplicity and consistency. There is nothing fun or semantic about heavily nested markup, forced upon you by your style system. So we took the fantastic [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) on MDN and developed a stylesheet that would allow us write basic HTML that look great!.

## Installation

### Via CDN

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhlpa/nhlpa.css/main/nhlpa.css">`

### Manually

You can self-host or copy + paste the stylesheet into your project by grabbing [nhlpa.css](https://github.com/nhlpa/nhlpa/blob/master/nhlpa.css) directly.

## Find a bug?

There's an [issue](https://github.com/nhlpa/nhlpa.css/issues) for that.
