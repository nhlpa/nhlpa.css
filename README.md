## Getting Started

The point of the library is to encourage and support writing basic HTML, so the best way to learn is to starting writing an HTML document. You can also view the [demo](demo.html) for a full-ish reference, or the [css](nhlpa.css) file itself which is intended to be self-documenting.

## Design Goals

We love HTML, simplicity and consistency. There is nothing fun or semantic about heavily nested markup, forced upon you by your style system. So we took the fantastic [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) on MDN and developed a stylesheet that would allow us write basic HTML that look great!.

## Installation

### Manually

We recommend that you can self-host the stylesheet in your project by downloading or copying the [nhlpa.css](https://github.com/nhlpa/nhlpa/blob/master/nhlpa.css) file directly.

### Via CDN

You can also reference the file via the GitHub CDN.
